### Java-Playground
The adwordy sub-directory is a (simple) simulation of ranking ad-words in order to determine best fit. Program starts in Main.java.

The output looks like the following, with lower rank indicating lower cost per click through:
```
starting
Word(s): "okay"	rank: 0.05	cost: $4.99	click through 99%
Word(s): "superduper"	rank: 0.10	cost: $0.10	click through 1%
Word(s): "awesome"	rank: 0.50	cost: $1.00	click through 2%
Word(s): "cat"	rank: 1.00	cost: $2.01	click through 2%
Word(s): "dog"	rank: 1.01	cost: $3.02	click through 3%
done.
